How delightful! This piece of code generates a random OTP (One-Time Password) and prompts the user to enter their username. It then displays a friendly greeting, along with the generated OTP for the user to use during login.


After that, the code asks the user to input the OTP for verification. If the entered OTP matches the generated OTP, it prints "Successfully Login!" as a confirmation. However, if the entered OTP doesn't match, it prints "Failed to login."


Overall, it's a simple and straightforward way to implement an OTP-based login system. Just make sure to handle the secure storage and validation of OTPs in a proper and secure manner.
